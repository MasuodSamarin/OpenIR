Universal Infrared Remote Control

This project started in 2013 after the remote control for my DSLR stopped working. Rather than buy a new one for less than Â£5 I decided to spend the next few months designing a replacement. The project grew over time and the goal now is to create a programmable remote control with multiple connectivity options including: 

- PC (USB via FTDL cable) 
- Raspberry Pi 
- Bluetooth 
- Wireless (via Electric Imp) 

A full description of the journey is contained in my blog (http://blog.mark-stevens.co.uk) and the Hackaday project (http://hackaday.io/project/1939-OpenIR---Infrared-Remote-Control) is a condensed set of construction details. 

The hardware designs are release OSH and the software is released under creative commons licence making this project fully open source.
